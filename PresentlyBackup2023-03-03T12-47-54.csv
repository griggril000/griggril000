Lessons learned
I was wanting to deliver something to Val and Genia in North Orem (I am in South Orem). I was going to after work, but I figured in the travel to the store and then their house. It would have to work out perfectly for me not to be late home for a missionary visit so I put it off. I got home and had the thought to go back to the store which was close by bus to work where I had just come home from. I waited for a bit and then calculated I wouldn't be back on time for a lesson.
It turned out that Joiner didn't answer and so the missionaries came by and checked in with me to see if he answered for a lesson, then left.
I saw opportunities afterwards that showed it would have been possible to visit Val and Genia and have the missionaries over. I believe this was a test from the Lord allowing me to take a leap of faith when it seemed that it wouldn't be possible to do two of the things I had to do."

I knew that bus could take me home, and may be faster than continuing on the bus to Provo I was already on then taking the train to Orem next to where I lived.

I looked it up on the transit app and sure enough it would be faster. I got off the bus and had about 2 minutes it said to catch the next bus so I waited at the crosswalk and was able to cross and catch the bus!

I realized getting off the bus with it being the Labor Day holiday, that I may miss the bus and have to wait 30 minutes as opposed to 10 on a normal day to catch it again, but I was able to catch it and get home on time. :)"
